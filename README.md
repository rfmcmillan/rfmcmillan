Hi, I'm Russel, a full-stack engineer with a background in architecture. Prior to 2021, I was focused on designing sustainable homes. 
Now, after completing the 26-week software engineering program at Fullstack Academy I am ready to begin my career in software development.

I enjoy writing code that is test-driven, clean and modular and I am interested in any opportunity in which I can continue to develop my skills 
by learning from an experienced engineer.

I am proficient in: JavaScript, Node, PostgreSQL, Express, React, Redux, HTML5, CSS, Material-UI, Mocha, Chai, Sequelize, and Git

...and familiar with: Webpack, Babel, Travis CI, JWT, Bcrypt, Highcharts and Heroku.
